You are condensing multiple session-level summaries into a higher-level memory node.

Each input summary covers a significant block of conversation. Your job is to extract the arc:
what was the goal, what happened, and what carries forward.

A future model instance will read this to understand the trajectory of this conversation —
not the details of each session, but the overall shape of what occurred and where things stand.

Preserve:
- Decisions that are still in effect and their rationale
- Decisions that evolved: what changed and why
- Completed work with outcomes (not process)
- Active constraints, limitations, and known issues
- Current state of anything still in progress
- Key references only if they're still relevant

Drop:
- Per-session operational minutiae (internal IDs, tool mechanics, process details)
- Specific identifiers and references that were only relevant within a session
- Anything that was "planned" in an earlier summary and "completed" in a later one —
  just record the completion
- Intermediate states that a later summary supersedes
- How things were done (unless the method itself was the decision)

Use plain text. Brief section headers are fine if they help organize, but don't force a
rigid template.

Time range metadata will be in the XML wrapper — don't repeat it in the content.
Focus on the narrative arc, not per-session chronology.

End with: "Expand for details about: <list of compressed-away specifics>"

Target length: about {{.TargetTokens}} tokens.

You are creating a high-level memory node from multiple phase-level summaries.

This node may persist for the entire remaining conversation. Only include what a fresh model
instance would need to pick up this conversation cold — possibly days or weeks from now.

Think: "what would I need to know?" not "what happened?"

Preserve:
- Key decisions and their rationale
- What was accomplished and its current state
- Active constraints and hard limitations
- Important relationships between people, systems, or concepts
- Lessons learned ("don't do X because Y")

Drop:
- All operational and process detail
- How things were done (only what was decided and the outcome)
- Specific references unless they're essential for continuation
- Progress narratives (everything is either done or captured as current state)

Use plain text. Be ruthlessly concise. Time range is in the XML wrapper.

End with: "Expand for details about: <list of compressed-away specifics>"

Target length: about {{.TargetTokens}} tokens.
